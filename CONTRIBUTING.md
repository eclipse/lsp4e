## 🆕 Trying latest builds

Latest snapshot builds, for testing, can usually be found at `https://download.eclipse.org/lsp4e/snapshots/` .


## 🧑‍💻 Developer resources

### ⌨️ Setting up the Development Environment

#### Install Software

1. Install the **Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers** from https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/ or
  any another Eclipse distrubition with:
    1. [Plug-in Development Environment (PDE)](https://www.eclipse.org/pde/) installed
    1. Eclipse [m2e](https://www.eclipse.org/m2e/) installed
1. To run Maven builds from the command line, install [JDK17](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17) and [Maven 3.9.x](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

#### Import Project

1. Clone this repository <a href="https://mickaelistria.github.io/redirctToEclipseIDECloneCommand/redirect.html"><img src="https://mickaelistria.github.io/redirctToEclipseIDECloneCommand/cloneToEclipseBadge.png" alt="Clone to Eclipse IDE"/></a> for LSP4E.
1. _File > Open Projects from Filesystem..._ , select the path to the LSP4E Git repo and the relevant children projects you want to import
1. Depending on the task you're planning to work on, multiple workflows are available to configure the [target-platform](https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.pde.doc.user/concepts/target.htm?cp=4_1_5)
    * In many cases, this simplest workflow will be sufficient: Install latest LSP4E snapshot in your target-platform (can be your current IDE), or
    * If you don't want to mix versions of LSP4E, open [target-platforms/target-platform-latest/target-platform-latest.target](target-platforms/target-platform-latest/target-platform-latest.target) from within Eclipse and click **Set as Active Target-Platform** in the top right corner.
1. Open the project modules you want to work on (right-click > Open project) and their dependencies
1. Happy coding! 🤗

### 🏗️ Build

1. From the command line: run `mvn clean verify`
1. From within Eclipse : right-click on the LSP4E root folder > Run As > Maven build

### Running single unit tests via the command line

To run single unit tests via the command line, one can use the following command from the project's root:
```
mvn -Dtest=<TestClassName>#<MethodName> -DfailIfNoTests=false verify
```

For example:
```
mvn -Dtest=HighlightTest#testCheckIfOtherAnnotationsRemains -DfailIfNoTests=false verify
```

To run a unit test in JVM debug mode via the command line one can use:
```
mvn -Dtest=<TestClassName>#<MethodName> -DfailIfNoTests=false -Dtycho.testArgLine="-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=localhost:8000" verify
```
Once Maven is about to execute the test it will wait for you to attach to the test JVM using a remote debugger, e.g. using Eclipse's `Remote Java Application` debug configuration.


### ⬆️ Version bump

LSP4E tries to use OSGi Semantic Version (to properly expose its API contracts and breakage) and Reproducible Version Qualifiers (to minimize the avoid producing multiple equivalent artifacts for identical source).
This requires the developer to manually bump version from time to time. Some rules are that:

* Versions are bumped on a __per module grain__ (bump version of individual bundles/features one by one when necessary), __DON'T bump version of parent pom, nor of other modules you don't change__
* __Versions are bumped maximum once per release__ (don't bump versions that were already bumped since last release)
* __Don't bump versions of what you don't change__
* __Bump version of the bundles you're modifying only if it's their 1st change since last release__
* Version bump may need to be cascaded to features that *include* the artifact you just changed, and then to features that *include* such features and so on (unless the version of those features were already bumped since last release).

The delta for version bumps are:

* `+0.0.1` (next micro) for a bugfix, or an internal change that doesn't surface to APIs
* `+0.1.0` (next minor) for an API addition
* `+1.0.0` (next major) for an API breakage (needs to be discussed on the mailing-list first)
* If some "smaller" bump already took place, you can replace it with your "bigger one". Eg, if last release has org.eclipse.lsp4e 1.16.1; and someone already bumped version to 1.16.2 (for an internal change) and you're adding a new API, then you need to change version to 1.17.0
